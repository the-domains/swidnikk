  You darkness, that I come from,  I love you more than all the fires that fence
  in the world,  for the fire makes a circle of light for everyone, and then no
  one outside learns of you.

You darkness, that I come from,   
I love you more than all the fires  
that fence in the world,   
for the fire makes  
a circle of light for everyone,  
and then no one outside learns of you.

But the darkness pulls in everything:  
shapes and fires, animals and myself,  
how easily it gathers them!---  
powers and people---

and it is possible a great energy  
is moving near me.

I have faith in nights.  
~Rainer Maria Rilke
