# Lost Carriage 

Shrouded silver lightful, mists of mysteries.  
Growing ever growing, spreading ever spreading.  
Smiles across faces grow then widen.

Rain sparkles, clouds heavy, ground above.  
The News before this News: sweet, as, silan.  
Now thick the rolling swell of the sea,   
Crashing across places, crashing across darkness.

Sweet rivers flow fresh to salt places.  
Salt waters to fresh places,   
how they can flow. You know.

Renew, the silver goblets with drink,  
the goblets are empty this day. 

Fill. Rejoice. Not today.
