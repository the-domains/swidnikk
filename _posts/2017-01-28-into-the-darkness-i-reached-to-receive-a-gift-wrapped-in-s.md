# Courage in Darkness

Into the darkness I reached to receive a gift,   
wrapped in soft gravel, a conspiring rain,   
and blades of green grass;   
proffered by the silence of smiling shadows.

May you have the courage to reach into   
the darkness for what you are seeking;   
to be surprised by what you receive,   
with confidence and knowing.
