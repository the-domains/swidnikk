  Golden light is turning grey, Mists begin to rule the day. Bare the trees,
  their branches lift; Clouds of dead leaves earthward drift.

_Golden light is turning grey,  
Mists begin to rule the day.  
Bare the trees, their branches lift;  
Clouds of dead leaves earthward drift._

_Through the field the farmer goes,  
Seeds of ripened corn he sows;  
Trusts the earth will hold it warm,  
Shelter it from cold and harm._

_For he knows, that warmth and light  
Live there, hidden from our sight;  
And beneath a sheltering wing,  
Deep below, new life will spring!_

_Deep below, deep below, new life will spring!_
