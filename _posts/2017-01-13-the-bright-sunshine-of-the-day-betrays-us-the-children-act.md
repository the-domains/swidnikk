In the darkness I am awakened by the quick patter of footsteps across the living room. I recognize the sound of little feet, now approaching muted on the carpet up the stairs. The boy slips to safety beneath the heavy covers with rapid heart and breath.

In late September the northern hemisphere sunshine at noon betrays us with retreat. Tomorrow, darkness rises and shadows grow. In the park, a drum beats slowly and each reverberation announces the coming of change like rumbles from the earth. Children stand gathered with their teachers before an empty stage. Parents chit chat quietly to assemble their blankets, quilted together in the green grass.

In the park on a wide green lawn sit parents gathered for Michaelmas. The bright sunshine of the day betrays us. Gathered with one another, friends new and old, the meaning forgotten, many choose instead to chatter amongst their bread and spread.

_Walking with a veil unlifted I go_  
_As I sing songs to the earth,_  
_Walking with a veil unlifted I go_  
_And she gives strength to me. _  
_Mighty is my courage, mighty is my strength,_
