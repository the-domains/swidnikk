I dreamed that I was a light bulb.

The bright sunshine of the day betrays us. The children act out a ritual, a festival, long forgotten. The adults have lost the meaning and choose instead to chatter amongst their bread and spreads. The beat of the deep drum is a slow reverberation, a steady reminder. Recall the silk and grey, the running and the flowing of the darkness that pervades our world, in shapes and forms forgotten. These times, so dark, the children unaware of what they have not unleashed.

Project hope.

I dreamed that my pinkys fell off.

Darkness lurks. Shadows and scales of the underbelly. The seriousness of the children in their festival. When we do not stand as one, the darkness can divide us. Hatred is dark. Darkness is beneath the soil where seeds cannot reach the light.
