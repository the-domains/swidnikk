  On that dark night, a downpour was rumored. Halloween arrived with the looming
  low clouds. People are walking street blocks and crossing headlight beams
  towards a sanctuary from vehicles. Children and parents in tow, determined to
  go on, form a swirling procession of umbrellas and motley costumes. Make your
  way from home to home like an insomniac wanders from thought to thought.

On that dark night, a downpour was rumored. Halloween arrived with the looming low clouds. People are walking street blocks and crossing headlight beams towards a sanctuary from vehicles. Children and parents in tow, determined to go on, form a swirling procession of umbrellas and motley costumes. Make your way from home to home like an insomniac wanders from thought to thought.

On a gentle hill, they climbed and a procession of performers float past, twirling slowly their painted white faces, their jackets white with coat tails or skirts rising with swirls, their bowing with white top hats twirling in hand. A woman steps near, raises her arms, lifts a leg, and bares her vampire teeth and breast. The rain drops freeze in mid air.

On Saturday morning, pancakes are piling up, the sweet smell pervades the air and yet, in the kitchen he is crying.
