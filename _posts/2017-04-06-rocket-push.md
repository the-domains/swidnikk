# Rocket Push

I was living in Tel Aviv when my daughter Mika was born. Nearly every day I'd bike to the large urban park, Park Ha'yarkon that defines the northern boundary of the city. I would bike to picnics and barbecues, for playdates and solitude. But biking in the city was another story. As I biked the short distance to Mika's daycare, I became Indiana Jones in a Temple of Doom strewn with booby traps and obstacles to discourage the young cyclist. On narrow sidewalks I weaved between pedestrians, dog poop, and stray cats. As if avoiding poisonous darts, I would duck beneath overgrown hedges. Cars and scooters parked in the bike lanes forced me onto the roads where buses threatened to roll over me. My favorite day of the year was the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur---no cars---pedestrians and cyclists could traverse the city without fear.

I day dreamed of changing the situation single handedly but, really what could I do alone? So, after further frustration and thought, I joined a handful of other volunteers at "Israel B'shvil Ofanaim," the national bike organization that lobbies in support of bike legislation and infrastructure.

Last year was the hottest on record. It was also the year I quit my job at one of the Valley's hottest tech companies. I've been mindful of Climate Change for a while, but last year was a turning point. During my slow traffic heavy commute up and down highway 85 to Palo Alto, I decided to hear the science first hand and listened to the audio book Storms of My Grandchildren, by NASA climatologist Dr. James Hansen. In 1988, Hansen testified before congress about Climate Change. He was the first to raise broad awareness of the subject. Parts of the book are technical, very sleepy, and it's a wonder I survived my daily commute. The book is also scary. Rising sea levels, super storms, ocean acidification, droughts, mass extinction, fossil fuel subsidies, and political inaction. Hansen believes that for life on our planet to remain stable we must maintain carbon dioxide in the atmosphere around 350 ppm. We hit 400 ppm this May. In National Geographic it was written that the last time CO2 levels were this high, "it was between 2.6 and 5.3 million years ago". Climate Change is scary.

Mika will start first grade this fall and my daughter Zoe attends preschool here at Shir Hadash. Together we ride our bikes to school. When she rides up Blossom Hill Blvd I give her "rocket pushes". A rocket push is a maneuver where, while pedaling together uphill, I place one hand upon her back and give her a great shove, transferring some of my momentum to propel her forward. Once, while crossing the bridge over Highway 17 on Blossom Hill Blvd, I slowed and paused, as if I had arrived for an appointment to gaze out over the endless stream of vehicles. Suddenly, I became overwhelmed by immense feelings of grief, sadness, and despair. The sheer magnitude of the problems facing this next generation, facing my children, are overwhelming at times...
